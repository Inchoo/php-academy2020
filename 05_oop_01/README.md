## 5. Homework

### Preconditions
1. GitHub profile

### Mandatory 
__Task1__
1. Create x number (minimum 3) of classes that have viewAction() method that outputs class name
2. in index.php in root of homework make a logic that randomly chooses one of those classes.
3. Create a main App class that based on random input (choosen class) given from index.php outputs their viewAction()
4. Each class should have a namespace (some classes can even share a namespace if you like). Put classes in directories how you feel it is right.

### Extra points
1. Use interfaces and abstract classes where you feel they should go.
2. Add Extra class `Prefix` that has only private properties. Set current date in one of the properties (example format: 09/09/2020).
3. Add this class to property of choosen class and prepend its date inside the choosen class before viewAction() output.
